For this assignment, we created a BigInteger ADT that essentially takes in numbers bigger than a scope of long. With these BigIntegers, we are able to commit various arithmetic operations such as add, subtract, multiply, etc. There are also access functions that tell the sign of the bigInteger and we are also able to reset the bigInteger if needed. Finally, there are overloaded operations which allow us to do A + D. I used all the helper functions in the pa6 pdf to help with my arithmetic operations. The two things that define a BigIntgeer are it's sign and a list of numbers. The sign tells whether the number is positive, negative, or a zero. The List is from a List ADT which contains the big integer numbers in base b which is set as a constant at the beginning of BigInteger.cpp. The Arithmetic.cpp pretty much reads 2 inputs creates bigIntegers out of them. After creating them, various operations are performed on them and are inputted onto the second file.
