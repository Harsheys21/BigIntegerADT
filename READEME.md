For this assignment, we have developed a custom Abstract Data Type (ADT) known as BigInteger, designed to accommodate numerical values exceeding the range of standard long integers. Within the scope of BigIntegers, we have implemented a comprehensive suite of arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. Additionally, we have incorporated accessor methods to ascertain the sign of the BigInteger, and have provided functionality to reset the value of the BigInteger when necessary. Furthermore, we have implemented overloaded operators to facilitate operations such as A + D.
In the implementation process, I utilized the auxiliary functions outlined in the pa6 PDF document to augment the efficacy of my arithmetic operations. Notably, a BigInteger is characterized by two key attributes: its sign and a collection of numerical elements stored within a List ADT. This List contains the BigInteger numbers represented in base 'b', a constant established at the onset of the BigInteger.cpp file.
In the Arithmetic.cpp file, the program primarily reads two input values and subsequently instantiates BigIntegers from them. Subsequently, a series of operations are performed on these BigIntegers, and the results are subsequently recorded in the second file.
